# Primitive Operators
Students are given homework in math, history, and geometry. The given program takes the time (in minutes) spent on each subject as input.

### Task
Complete the program to **calculate** and **output** the total number of hours and minutes spent on homework, each one on a **new line.**

### Sample Input
35\
40\
39

### Sample Output
1\
54

### Explanation
1 hour is 60 minutes.
In this case the total amount of spent minutes is 114 (35+40+39), which is equal to 1 hour (the first output) and 54 minutes (the second output).


> Use **/ operator** to calculate the hours and **% operator** for remaining minutes.
